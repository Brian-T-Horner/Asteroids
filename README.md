Brian Horner - Asteroids Ship Movement Clone

In this project I use the SFML multimedia library to do a clone of the game Asteroids ship movement. This program displays a GUI window that renders in a ship controllable by the player. The ship has rotation and can wrap around the various edges of the window. 
In order to control the ship use W, A, S, and D for Up, Left, Right, and Down movement respectively.

In order to run my project please install the SFML library for your windows system into your C drive. The cmake list and cmake modules should sucessfully gather all Graphics, Windows, & Event files needed from the Graphics library.

If it does not sucessfully run please contact me and I can help address the issues with the cmake modules or cmakelists

I originally had come into this project hoping to make a full side scrolling 2d rpg at least. Unfortunately I ran into some issues getting used to the package as well as gettin it to sucessfully work with my system. Positively I have a greater understanding of cmake files now.
Included in this project are my original Engine, States, GameStates, and Player class files that I was unable to get to work with my project. These were going to be the basis of a multi-level game (henece the GameStates and States classes) as well as include enemies. If interested I can include the build for Mac OS in which I experiemented with sprites and animation (another catch of the project where I got caught).




Requirements:
